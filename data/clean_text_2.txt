Welcome to Policy and Procedure Purpose/Interpretation 
 
The purpose of this Manual is to provide employees of TriageLogic (“TL”) with general information 
regarding the policies and procedures of the Company. Nothing in this manual or in any other documents 
(such as benefit statements, performance evaluations, or any other written or verbal communications) 
should be construed to create an employment agreement/contract (either expressed or implied) for

Writing or Revising Policy or Procedure 
 
If you are a TriageLogic employee who is writing or revising a policy or procedure, please consult section 
# 2 of this manual: Policy and Procedure Development & Maintenance. The policy outlines the policy 
and procedure formatting and organization, and the process for approval of policies and procedures. 
 
About Our Company CORE 2c 
 
Today, TriageLogic is a leading provider of quality, affordable triage solutions. We are a physician-led 
company that offers leading-edge nurse triage services. 
 
We serve busy practices in need of a phone triage system for patients. Some of our physician groups are 
part of a hospital or a health system. We service all locations in the United States. All groups of patients 
(e.g., pediatric, adult, geriatric) are covered by TriageLogic. 
 
Triage Logic Nurse Triage on Call provides telephone nurse triage coverage for providers and their 
patients. CORE 2b 
 
How it works: 
 
1. Patient calls and talks to a triage representative 
2. Nurse calls patient back and directs patient to the appropriate level of care 
3. As the nurse handles the call, the system documents all the details and the encounter is sent to the 
physician’s office 
 
Key Features: 
• 
Gold Standard Protocols from Schmitt-Thompson 
• 
All calls recorded 
• 
All licensed registered nurses 
• 
Call back average time less than 30 minutes 
 
 
Mission Statement CORE 2a 
 
Our mission is to continue to lead the field of nurse triage. We commit our expertise, compassion and 
reliability to services that exceed expectations of medical professionals and their patients. 
 
“Taking care of our communities one call at a time”

I. POLICY 
 
TriageLogic will maintain a policy and procedure manual online. A new electronic copy of the P/P in its 
entirety will be emailed to replace the existing manual should a revision or update occur. The P/P will be 
emailed to the managers and the managers are responsible to distribute to necessary staff. The 
policy/procedure will be emailed to PRN and other staff as it relates to their job. 
 
TriageLogic (TL) is dedicated to standardizing the way business is conducted among all staff (employed 
and contract). When people do things the same way every time, they eventually become able to complete 
the process in a shorter amount of time, which means they can do more work in the same amount of time. 
Consistency also breeds confidence. Consistent methods assure clients that the company will handle 
accounts with the same care and precision during each interaction. Consistency helps employees and 
alike know what to expect when faced with a given situation. 
 
TriageLogic has employees in multiple locations and/or employees that work different shifts, staff that 
leave the company and new employees will join the company. The easiest way to communicate 
expectations and processes to all employees without missing anyone, leaving information out or being 
inconsistent is to write and distribute a formal policy and procedure document. Making sure that everyone 
has access to the same information assures quality management. 
 
All policies and procedures will be reviewed and approved by the Planning/Strategy/Regulatory 
Committee annually, between the months of August and October. This includes all policies and 
procedures related to the following: Clinical Policies, Quality, and IT. CORE 3c. Since policies and 
procedures can change throughout the year, new policies and procedure revisions can be brought to any 
weekly committee for approval and documented in the minutes. 
 
Depending on the change made to the policy/procedure, employee training will take place at individual 
monthly meetings. In addition, when the policy is updated, the employee will receive a current copy of 
the policy/procedure manual in its entirety and will attest they received it and will comply. 
 
A standardized format for policies and procedures will not be required at TriageLogic as some forms are 
better than others for a given process; however, the following are required of every TL policy and 
procedure.

operations, and for providing evidence of business activities and transactions. They assist in making better

before. 
 
Therefore, records are to be:

Recordkeeping and Document Management System 
 
TriageLogic’s recordkeeping and document management system assists staff to capture records, protect 
their integrity and authenticity, provide access through time, dispose of records no longer required in the 
conduct of its business, and ensure records of enduring value are retained. It also facilitates the creation, 
version control, authority of official corporate documents. 
TriageLogic’s recordkeeping and document management system is managed by the office of the CEO. 
 
TriageLogic has authorized recordkeeping and document management system in either paper form, Sugar 
Sync and in its Call Center Software System. 
 
All staff is to use the Call Center Software and Sugar Sync to ensure that: 
 
• 
official records and documents are routinely captured and subjected to the relevant retention 
and disposal authority; 
• 
access to records and documents is managed according to authorized access and appropriate 
retention times regardless of location; 
• 
records and documents are protected from unauthorized alteration or deletion; 
• 
documents are version controlled as required; 
 
All staff, who create, receive and keep records and documents as part of their daily work, should do so in 
accordance with established policies, procedures and standards. Staff should not undertake disposal of 
records without authority – and only in accordance with authorized disposal methods.

1. 
Commitment to Compliance 
 
a.) 
Standards of Conduct 
 
TriageLogic promotes adherence to the Compliance Program as a major element in the 
performance evaluation of all staff members. TriageLogic employees are bound to comply, in 
all official acts and duties, with all applicable laws, rules, regulations, standards of conduct, 
including, but not limited to laws, rules, regulations, and directives of the federal government 
and the state of Florida, URAC standards and rules, and policies and procedures of 
TriageLogic. 
These current and future standards of conduct are incorporated by reference in this 
Compliance Plan. 
 
All candidates for employment shall undergo a reasonable and prudent investigation. Criminal 
background checks will be performed on all staff that will have access to PHI, along with 
verification of licensure status, certification credentials verification and reference checks, to the 
extent permitted by law. Due care will be used in the recruitment and hiring process to prevent 
the appointment to positions with substantial discretionary authority, persons whose record 
(professional licensure, credentials, prior employment) gives reasonable cause to believe the 
individual has a propensity to fail to adhere to applicable standards of conduct. CORE 4 b 
 
All new employees will receive orientation and a copy of TriageLogic’s compliance policies 
and procedures. Participation is a required training condition of employment. 
 
Every employee will receive periodic training as changes or revisions occur to the initial 
compliance training received upon hire. 
 
In addition, all employees with access to patient information or any other private information 
are required to sign our standard HIPAA agreement (as shown below at the end of this table). 
 
Non-compliance with the plan or violations will result in sanctioning of the involved 
employee(s) up to, and including, termination of employment. 
 
b.) 
Marketing 
 
TriageLogic will promote only honest, straightforward, fully informative, and non-deceptive 
marketing. 

 
 
 
22 
 
c.) 
Retention of Records/Documentation 
 
Triage Logic will ensure that all records required by federal and/or state law are created and 
maintained. All records will be maintained for a period of no less than seven years. Audio 
records will be kept for a period of 3 months. Documentation of compliance efforts will 
include staff meeting minutes, memoranda concerning compliance, problems identified and 
corrective actions taken, the results of any investigations, and documentation supportive of 
assessment findings and plan of  care. 
 
2. Designation of a Compliance Officer 
 
TriageLogic has a designated compliance officer to serve as the coordinator of all compliance 
activities. 
 
The responsibilities of the compliance officer are: 
• 
Overseeing and monitoring the implementation of the compliance program 
• 
Reporting as needed to the Medical Director/COO and subsequent affected committees of 
compliance issues, policy and procedure changes/revisions. 
• 
Developing and distributing or giving to the CEO to distribute all written compliance 
policies and procedures to all affected employees. 
• 
Periodically revising the program in light of changes in the needs of the organization and in 
the law; and changes in policies and procedures of government. 
• 
Developing and coordinating educational and training programs that focus on the elements 
of the compliance program and seeks to ensure that all employees are knowledgeable of, 
and comply with, pertinent federal and state standards. 
 
The compliance officer has the authority to review all documents and other information relative to 
compliance activities, including, but not limited to, records concerning marketing efforts, 
arrangements and agreements with clients, HIPAA documentation and patient data. 
 
3. Conducting Training and Educational Programs CORE (b) 
 
TriageLogic requires all employees to attend specific training upon hire and on a p.r.n. basis 
thereafter. This will include training in federal and state regulations, program requirements, 
policies and procedures. The training will emphasize TL’s commitment to compliance with these 
legal requirements and policies. The amount of training will depend on the degree of compliance 
issues handled by the employee based on the job description. 
 
4. 
Communication CORE 4c 
 
TriageLogic has an open-door policy where employees may seek clarification from the compliance 
officer in the event of any confusion or questions regarding a policy or procedure. 

 
 
 
23 
 
Any person who has reason to believe that a potential problem or questionable practice is or may 
be in existence should report the circumstance to the Compliance Officer. Such reports may be 
made verbally or in writing, and may be made on an anonymous basis. The Compliance Officer 
will promptly document and investigate reported matters that suggest substantial violations of 
policies, regulations, statutes, or program requirements to determine their veracity. The 
compliance officer will maintain a log of such reports, including the nature of the investigation and 
its results. All compliance issues will be shared with the Medical Director/COO promptly. 
 
The Compliance Officer will work closely with legal counsel who can provide guidance regarding 
complex legal and management  issues. 
 
Compliance officer or the CEO will report any changes to policy and new laws and regulations 
during the general management meeting. Such matters will be documented in the minutes and 
emailed to all employees who are affected by the new law or policy. 
 
5. 
Disciplinary Guidelines 
 
All members of TriageLogic will be held accountable for failing to comply with applicable 
standards, laws, and procedures. Supervisors and/or managers will be held accountable for the 
foreseeable compliance failures of their subordinates. 
 
The supervisor or manager will be responsible for taking appropriate disciplinary actions in the 
event an employee fails to comply with applicable regulations or policies.  The disciplinary 
process for violations of compliance programs will be administered according to practice protocols 
(generally oral warning, written warning, suspension without leave, leading to termination) 
depending upon the seriousness of the violation. 
 
If the deviation occurred due to legitimate, explainable reasons, the compliance officer and 
supervisor/manager may want to limit disciplinary action or take no action. If the deviation 
occurred because of improper procedures, misunderstanding of rules, including systemic 
problems, the compliance officer will take immediate actions to correct the problem. 
 
After receipt of an investigative report, the Compliance Officer and Medical Director/COO shall 
determine the action to be taken upon the matter. 
 
6. 
Auditing and Monitoring 
 
The Compliance Officer will conduct evaluation of compliance on an as needed basis and 
regularly report to the Medical Director/COO. Compliance officer is responsible for: 
 
a) Keeping track of laws and regulations in the jurisdictions that the company conducts 
business. This may involve seeking guidance from an outside counsel on the current laws

Corrective Action 
 
Violations of TriageLogic’s compliance program, failure to comply with applicable state or 
federal law, and other types of misconduct may threaten TL’s status as a reliable, honest, and 
trustworthy business. Detected, but uncorrected, misconduct may seriously endanger the mission, 
reputation, and legal status of TriageLogic. Consequently, upon reports or reasonable indications 
of suspected noncompliance, the Compliance Officer must initiate an investigation to determine 
whether a material violation of applicable laws or requirements has occurred. 
 
The steps in the internal investigation may include interviews and a review of relevant 
documentation. Records of the investigation should contain documentation of the alleged 
violation, a description of the investigative process, and the documents reviewed, the results of 
the investigation, and the corrective actions implemented. 
 
If the results of the internal investigation identify a problem, the response may be development of 
a corrective action plan, and reporting to the affected parties. Corrective action should be 
completed within 30 business days. CORE 4c 
 
This compliance plan may be altered or amended in writing only with the concurrence of the 
Compliance Officer. The adoption of this Compliance Plan has been approved and authorized as 
designed below.

I. 
Purpose 
To understand what state and federal laws and regulations apply to providing nurse triage services 
and to ensure that these laws and regulations are followed by staff of TriageLogic. To implement a 
process to monitor changes to state and federal laws related to nurse triage services and put these

II. Procedure 
A. Steps for Initial Entry Into a State To Provide Nurse Triage Services 
1. Determine if the state participates in the nursing compact or requires state specific 
licensure for the nurses providing nurse triage services.

practice telephone triage nursing. Determine if there are any special laws on what a nurse 
can or cannot do in that state related to triage services. 
3. Check with Legal Counsel to see what the corporate requirements are for offering triage 
services in that state. (For example: in California you must file as an LLC to do business 
in that state). 
4. Use NexisLexis and/or Westlaw and/or internet search to research any state and federal 
laws related to nurse triage. 
 
Once the four steps above have been completed, the results will be added to the crosswalk 
for annual monitoring of each states rules and regulations. 
 
B. Steps for Annual Monitoring after Initial Entry Into a State 
1. The Compliance Officer or an RN within the company will review the states nurses’ 
license requirement (compact or state specific) and review the board of nursing to see if 
there have been any interval changes for nurse triage requirements. 
2. Check with legal counsel to see if there has been any change to the state laws to provide 
services in that state. 
3. Use NexisLexis and/or Westlaw and/or internet search to research any state and federal 
laws related to nurse triage. 
 
The Corporate Compliance Officer will be responsible for monitoring on a yearly basis all 
State, Federal and Nursing Laws. 

 
 
 
27 
The Compliance Officer along with the CEO and Medical Director will review any changes 
to policies and procedures that need to be made to meet new requirements. 
 
Affected staff will receive education on any new rule or law that may affect their position.

2. Inter-Departmental Coordination – CORE 5 
 
Interdepartmental communication in a nurse triage setting is fundamental to the provision of quality patient 
care. Effective communication modes are important because they result in the improvement of patient care. 
 
TriageLogic implements the following processes for interdepartmental communication: 
 
Regular Department/Team Meetings. Discuss progress over the past week, what lies ahead, and use the 
opportunity to give positive feedback and improve morale. See for example, TriageLogic’s Management 
meetings. 
 
 
Team Briefing. This is a way of passing information from the top of the business down to all employees, 
and allowing employees to send feedback to the top management. 
 
Interdepartmental/Interdisciplinary Teams. Occasionally, we foster communication across departments 
and functions by creating teams to work on projects such as identifying cost savings or improved quality. 
 
Newsletters. TriageLogic publishes newsletters with contributions from employees and information about 
current activities within the company. We publish both newsletters designed for outside audience as well as 
internal newsletters. 
 
Meeting Minutes. We document action items and who is responsible for completing them at the end of 
meetings. 
 
 
Email. 
 
Social Networking. TriageLogic uses for technologies such as http://www.twitter.com and Facebook to 
communicate company information.

IV. PURPOSE 
 
The purpose of this policy and procedure is to establish the lines of responsibility for, and the standard of, 
TriageLogic’s (TL) branding, marketing and communications efforts to its clients and consumers. This 
policy and procedure applies to all TL divisions, partners, departments and programs. 
 
V. 
POLICY 
 
The goal of TriageLogic’s marketing and sales communications policy is to produce both internal and

marketing and sales communications for the company. 
 
The Chair/CEO participates in the marketing meeting and is charged with oversight for the development 
of marketing and communications strategies, and for coordinating the external communications activities 
of TL. A marketing representative also reports marketing activities and plans during the management 

 
 
 
33

I. 
PURPOSE AND SCOPE 
 
The purpose of this guideline is to ensure the efficient operation of Triage Logic, LLC (the 
“Company”) by providing guidelines for the appropriate signature authority and delegation of 
authority required for various transactions and activities at the Company. 
 
II. GUIDELINE STATEMENT 
 
In order to promote greater economy and efficiency, the Company has delegated authority 
concerning certain activities, such as nurse triage work. Accountability for the management of the 
delegated work by the Company ultimately rests with the CEO who expects those with signature 
authority under the terms of this guideline to safeguard Company resources by establishing and 
maintaining sound business controls that deter and detect any potential misuse of resources and 
legal requirements. The procedures outlined below identify those situations in which it is 
appropriate to use delegations of authority and the procedures that should be followed to make 
such delegations. 
 
III. DEFINITIONS 
 
Delegation of authority: As used in this guideline, a “delegation of authority” is the formal 
recorded conveyance of authority from the Company to the individual presidents and/or 
designees. Any such transfers of powers and duties are therefore significant actions requiring 
great care and scrutiny. 
 
Delegator: The employee who has authority to take action on behalf of the Company who 
transfers (“delegates”) his/her authority to an outside contractor (“Delegate”). 
 
Delegate: The contractor who is officially transferred the authority to act on behalf of the 
delegator. 
 
Signature authority: As used in this policy, “signature authority” is the permission to execute 
transactions up to limits established by relevant Company policies and permission to approve 

 
 
 
35 
transactions for execution. This approval attests to the appropriateness of the transaction within 
Company’s objectives and budgetary authorizations. 
 
Responsible: Chair/CEO and Medical Director COO 
 
Purpose: TriageLogic (“TL”) developed and implemented a Delegation Oversight Program in an 
effort to make available a synopsis of the TL delegation process. The Delegation Oversight 
Program has four components as follows: (1) Selection of a Delegate; (2) Orientation for the 
entity approved for delegation; (3) Delegation Oversight; and (4) Withdrawal of Delegation. TL 
provides assessment and oversight for the following functions: PRN Nurse Call. 
 
At this time TriageLogic does not delegate to any contractor that would require a site visit. 
 
 
IV. GUIDELINE FOR PROPER DELEGATION OF AUTHORITY 
 
General Scope of Delegation 
 
Delegations of authority should be limited both in scope, number and time frame to those which 
are necessary to achieve efficiency while maintaining accountability. Delegations of authority are 
appropriate where the delegation will enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of the operation 
without risking the integrity of the internal control necessary for accountability. No delegation 
shall be made of all or substantially all of the powers held by any persons making a delegation, or 
where checks and balances would be minimized. Delegation of authority must not conflict with 
any Company policy. Individuals who receive delegated authority shall have active involvement 
with the activity being conducted; and have sufficient knowledge of the Company policies, rules, 
laws, regulations and procedures to ensure compliance, including compliance with URAC 
standards. CORE 8b 
 
Delegator will provide for training to the Delegate to ensure compliance with legislation and the 
policies referred to above. 
 
B. Selection of Delegate CORE 7 
 
Prior to delegating functions to another entity, the delegator and any other party assisting in 
finding a delegate must perform the following: 
 
1. Review all the potential contractors by doing the following: CORE 7a 
• 
Explore market for potential vendors 
• 
Meet with Owners 
• 
Due Diligence –such as references from current clients, surveys, discussion with 
current workers, etc. 
• 
Review contractor’s ability to perform delegated function according to company’s 
policy and procedure 
 
2. Each party involved with the decision will develop a list of criteria for what is needed 
from the delegated contractor. CORE 7b 
 
3. Enter into a written contract with contractor to satisfy URAC requirements CORE 8 a-• - h 

 
 
 
36 
 
Once a delegate has been selected, there must be a slow implementation of clients – a few at a 
time and evaluate capability and satisfaction. 
 
I. 
DELEGATION MANAGEMENT AND EFFECTIVE DATES 
 
The Office of the CEO will maintain a centralized file of all delegation of authority contracts 
related to this policy. 
 
A delegation of authority shall become effective on the date the delegation is fully executed and 
the contract between the delegator and delegate is signed. Delegations shall continue until 
revoked or modified. The departments are responsible for maintaining active and up to date 
delegations of authority and should review all delegations annually (or through ongoing reviews) 
to assure that the delegations on file are current. The delegation must be fully executed before any 
documents are signed by the Delegate. 
 
II. SIGNATURE AUTHORITY GUIDELINES CORE 8 
 
Within each department, the department head is responsible for the overall operations of the 
department and may assign signature authority to certain employees in compliance with this 
policy. The signature authority matrix will be updated for specific transactions and reported to 
the CEO office. 
 
Employees with signature authority are responsible for assuring thefollowing: 
• 
An understanding of what is being approved 
• 
Specifies the responsibilities being delegated to the contractor and those retained in the 
organization CORE 8a 
• 
The information and supporting documentation is accurate and complete 
• 
The transaction is allowable, legal, reasonable and justified 
• 
Services performed by delegate is in accordance the Company’s requirements and the 
requirements by the company’s certification requirements (such as URAC) CORE 8b 
• 
There are adequate funds to cover the expense 
• 
The internal controls for Delegation authority are specified (see below) 
 
III. INTERNAL CONTROLS FOR DELEGATION OF AUTHORITY 
 
It is the responsibility of the Delegator to maintain proper control and management of his/her 
area; the Delegator remains accountable for all actions taken by the Delegate. The Delegator 
shall take into account and maintain appropriate internal controls including separation of duties, 
reviewing reports, sampling completed transactions and monitoring the effectiveness of the 
controls established. Such controls need to be in writing in a contract between delegate and 
delegator. These internal controls need include (but are not limited to): 
 
a. Require notification to the organization of any material change in the contractor’s ability 
to perform delegated functions CORE 8c 
b. Specify that the organization may conduct surveys of the contractor, as needed CORE 8d 
 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
37 
C. Delegation Oversight CORE 9 
 
All transactions shall be authorized according to sound management practices. 
 
The fundamental premise of segregated duties is that an individual should not be in a position to 
initiate, approve, and review the same action. Delegator is responsible for oversight of the delegated 
function and reporting the effectiveness and oversight results to superiors. The following oversight 
items need to take place: 
 
1. An annual review of the contractor's written policies and documented procedures and 
documentation of quality activities for related delegated functions CORE 9a 
2. A continuing process to verify contractor's compliance with contractual requirements and 
written policies and documented procedures; such as scheduled meetings with Contractors 
(no less than once in a quarter) CORE 9b 
3. Scheduled meetings to discuss contractor’s financial transactions with other clients or general 
policies and contracts with other stakeholders to ensure that contractor has no financial 
incentive to deviate from contract agreement. CORE 9c Approximately every 8 weeks a 
PRN/TL Management meeting is held to discuss the proceeding items. 
4. Independent evaluation of delegate’s work by delegator to ensure quality and compliance. 
Independent evaluation may include for example, annual surveys of people affected by 
contractor’s work, scheduled verification of contractor’s actual work performance such as 
listening to phone calls, verifying billing, etc. 
 
I. 
ORIENTATION FOR THE ENTITY APPROVED FOR DELEGATION 
 
Upon approval, the Planning/Strategy/Regulatory Committee schedules orientation for newly 
delegated entities. The delegated entity receives information including but not limited to:

The method and frequency by which the reports and data will be received by TL. 
• 
Information regarding how and when the delegated entity must present reports to the 
appropriate committee. 
• 
Information regarding participation in TL Quality Improvement activities. 
 
II. WITHDRAWAL OF DELEGATION 
 
In the event the delegated entity does not comply with TL requirements, refuses to implement 
requested improvement strategy, and/or fails to submit the required documents/reports, TL will 
submit the information to the CEO office with the recommendation to withdraw delegation. 
 
All delegated activities are coordinated by the Planning/Strategy/Regulatory Committee with 
actual oversight and assessment conducted by the CEO. The Delegation Program is performed in 
collaboration with all TL committees and their policies and procedures specific to the delegated 
activity.

2. Hourly and daily database dumps of all data: this is in addition to the live replication so the data is 
stored in a third offline database. 

 
 
 
59 
3. Replication logs of every data change can be re-ran to rebuild databases. 
 
E. Data Center Infrastructure 
 
TriageLogic only uses SSAE-16 certified data centers with the appropriate security and infrastructure. 
Our vendor’s servers are collocated with Superb Internet (www.superb.net) 
 
Below is a summary of their certifications. Additional details are available on their website. 
Data Center Staff is ITIL Certified 
ITIL advocates that our IT services must be aligned to the needs of the business and underpin the core 
business processes. It provides guidance to our organizations on how to use IT as a tool to facilitate 
business change, transformation and growth. 
 
The ITIL best practices are currently detailed within five core publications which provide a systematic 
and professional approach to the management of IT services, enabling us to deliver appropriate services 
and continually ensure they are meeting business goals and delivering benefits. 
 
The five core guides map our entire ITIL Service Lifecycle, beginning with the identification of 
customers’ needs and drivers of IT requirements, through to the design and implementation of the 
service into operation and finally, on to the monitoring and improvement phase of the service. For more 
information on ITIL, visit www.itil-officialsite.com 
 
All 3 Data Centers are SSAE 16 Audited 
 
The SSAE-16 Auditing Standard is an enhancement to the current standard for Reporting on Controls at 
a Service Organization: the SAS70. These updates bring companies up-to-date with new international 
service organization reporting standards: the ISAE 3402. SSAE-16 is now effective as of June 15, 2011. 
All organizations are now required to issue their Service Auditor Reports under the SSAE-16 standards 
in an SOC1 Report. 
 
The integrity of our data recovery facilities and data hosting solutions The security of our IT assets

Below describes the different scenarios that can occur and how the operations are to continue. An email 
sent to 911@triagelogic.com will alert all the on call IT staff as well as the Medical Director and COO 
of an IT emergency. 
 
1. Primary server is unavailable – Nurse Manager verifies that more than one user is experiencing 
an inability to access the primary server. Nurse Manager sends an email to 911@triagelogic.com 
and directs everyone to the backup site Staff Policy and Procedure for IT Support. 
 
2. Primary and Backup server is unavailable - Nurse Manager verifies that more than one user is 
experiencing an inability to access the primary server and the backup server. Nurse manager sends 
an email to 911@triagelogic.com and directs everyone to manual triage mode which is described in 
the document Staff Policy and Procedure for Managing Calls Offline. 
 
 
F. Staff Policy and Procedure for if server is not available CORE 14A, B 
 
TriageLogic has determined that the maintenance of the software is crucial to the working of nurse 
triage. At a minimum, TriageLogic has determined that nurses must have access to protocols in order 
to be able to serve patients. As a result, we have the following process in place to ensure access to 
protocols at all times CORE 14A 
 
If the software is not available, the following process must take place: CORE 14B 
 
1. User Unable to Login: The user can get to the login screen but is unable to access the system. User 
must contact their nurse manager on call to inform them of the problem. The nurse managers have 
access and training to reset the user password after verifying the identity of the user. If the nurse 
manager determines that the user is a valid user and cannot get them to access the system, then the 
nurse manager will contact IT support 
 
2. Primary Server is unavailable: The user cannot access the login screen for the system. User must 
contact their nurse manager on call to inform them of the problem. 
 
a. The nurse manager will attempt to log in to the system and verify if they can access the system 
b. If the nurse manager is able to access and login to the system, then they will verify the server 
website with the user and reset their password to see if they are able to get access. If the user 
still cannot access the system, the nurse manager will contact IT support to report the problem. 
c. If the nurse manager verifies that they are unable to access the login screen as well, then the 
nurse manager will access emergency support and direct the nurses to the back-up site. 
 
3. Primary and Backup Server is unavailable: In the rare circumstance that both the primary and 
backup server is not available, the triage system will go into emergency mode which includes the 
following steps: 
 
a. Send an email out to the nursing staff to inform them that they must handle calls manually 
b. Contact the other nurse managers to inform them of the situation and enlist their help 
c. Contact the non-clinical staff and give them a fax number to start faxing the calls as they come 
in, instead of entering them directly into the triage system.

A. TriageLogic Information Security Policy 
 
TriageLogic has the following in place to prevent and detect security breaches: Core 15c 
 
1. Software Requirements 
 
TriageLogic will only contact with a software vendor if their software platform has the following 
minimum specifications as defined in BUSINESS CONTINUITY PLAN. In addition the software 
must support the following minimum requirements to allow for implementation of TriageLogic 
Information Security Policy. 
a. Role Based access to all Non Clinical, Clinical and PHI information in the system 
b. Role based access for administrative, edit and view privileges. 
c. Unique user name and password for each and every user 
d. Password requirements as per current security standards 
e. Logging of any view or edit actions in the system 
f. 
Ability to prevent alteration of a completed patient chart after it has been finalized. 
 
Triage logic also meets with vendor weekly to assess potential risks, integrity and vulnerabilities to the 
confidentiality of the information system. Any issues that management identifies are addressed by 
vendor immediately. For example, upon TriageLogic request vendor created HIPAA compliance 
texting to allow nurses to communicate with physicians confidentially. 
 
For example, the following issues are discussed over time: 
 
Security violation issues, vulnerability scanning plans, results from most recent vulnerability scan (scan 
done every 2 years), network penetration testing policy and procedure, results from most recent 
network penetration test (network penetration test done every 2 years), configuration standards to

2. Prevention, detection, containment, and correction of security violation CORE 15c 
 
a) Requirement for hiring and human access 
 
 
Work Environment 
As part of their orientation each clinical nurse user who works remotely must verify that they meet 
the following requirements 
1.) A dedicated room where they can work alone while taking calls or accessing the system. 
2.) A quiet environment without any background noise that would be audible to a caller. 
3.) High speed internet access (DSL, CABLE or Satellite). 
 
b) System Access 
All users have role-based access which is built into the software platform used by TriageLogic. 
All user access can be remotely controlled and modified in real time by the authorized system 
administrator. Each user must have the following minimum information in their system profile. 
1.)  First Name, Last Name, Date Of Birth, Home Zip Code, Home or cell phone number 
 
c) Nurse Manager Access: TriageLogic’s IT customer service representative can create a nurse 
manager user with written permission from the Medical Director or CEO. 
d) Nurse Users Access (Clinical Users): Nurse Managers are permitted to create a nurse user 
after the nurse has completed their orientation checklist. 
e) Non Clinical Staff Access: Each non clinical staff is given a unique user name and password 
with limited access to enter calls into the system. The Non Clinical Staff cannot view any 
patient encounters or data. The nurse triage client manager creates access for the non-clinical 
staff. 
f) Client Access: Each practice manager or system administrator can be granted access to their 
patient encounters and call schedules. The client is responsible for designating an authorized 
user to access the system and any changes in writing. The nurse triage client manager creates 
access for each practice after they have signed an agreement for services and makes any 
changes to the user access or creates new users. New practices are discussed at the weekly 
meeting and access is approved by the nurse managers. 
g) Resetting Passwords: The system allows for each individual to reset their own password by 
asking them to provide information within their system profile. 
h) Clinical User: If the clinical user is unable to access the system, then they must contact the 
nurse manager as per the Policy and Procedure for TriageLogic Support. 
i) 
Non Clinical User or Client: If a Non Clinical or Client user is unable to access the system, 
then they must contact their manager or supervisor who will then contact the client service 
manager to assist with access.

B. Policy on Emails and Other Forms of Communication 
Email is not secure. TriageLogic requires that email cannot contain PHI anywhere in the heading or 
body of the message. To view any PHI, the user has to log into the system with a user name and 
password. When communicating about patients via email, we refer to ticket numbers or note numbers 
without mentioning any PHI. Reports and recordings are sent as links for which the user has to login to 
view the PHI. None of the following items can be included in any unsecure communication.  
 
1. Names 
2. All geographical identifiers smaller than a state, except for the initial three digits of a zip code 
if, according to the current publicly available data from the Bureau of the Census: the 
geographic unit formed by combining all zip codes with the same three initial digits contains 
more than 20,000 people; and the initial three digits of a zip code for all such geographic units 
containing 20,000 or fewer people is changed to 000

All users of the system are NEVER required to print any information based on standard workflows. 
Users are NOT PERMITTED to print any information. 
If the user needs to make notes about a patient, then they must use a note number as a reference and omit 
any PHI on the written notes. 
 
In the unusual event that patient documents need to be printed, the Director of nursing/Nurse manager is 
the only one that is permitted to print information from the system with PHI. Any management staff who 
are permitted to print PHI have a cross-cut shredder at their desk to immediately shred the information 
after use.

Equal Employment Opportunity 
 
TriageLogic commits to providing a work environment that is free of discrimination. It is the policy of 
TriageLogic that all applicants and employees are entitled to equal employment opportunity regardless of 
race, color, religion or creed, gender (including pregnancy or related medical conditions), national origin, 
age, disability, marital status, sexual orientation, veteran status or other protected characteristics as required 
by local, state and federal law. 
 
In compliance with the provisions of all applicable state and federal civil rights laws, every effort will be 
made to employ the most qualified individuals without regard to the above factors. Additionally, it is and 
shall continue to be the Company’s policy to provide promotion and advancement opportunities in a non-
discriminatory fashion. TriageLogic is an equal opportunity employer. TriageLogic does not and will not 
permit any of its employees to engage in discriminatory practices involving their co- workers or individuals 
that they come in contact with as representatives of the Company. If an employee has an equal employment 
opportunity related question, problem, or complaint, they must first discuss it with their immediate 
manager/supervisor. If the employee is uncomfortable discussing the matter with their manager/supervisor, 
or if the matter involves their manager/supervisor, they may contact Human Resources and then the CEO. 
 
 
Employment-at-Will 
 
While the Company strives to make the employment relationship a mutually satisfying one, the Company can 
make no assurances, either express or implied, concerning the duration of employment. The employee and the 
Company have an employment-at-will relationship. The employment relationship is for an unspecified time 
period. Either the employee or the Company may terminate employment at any time, with or without reason 
or notice. In addition, it should be noted that no one has the right to alter the employment-at-will relationship 
other than the CEO of TriageLogic. Any such agreements by the CEO must be in writing and signed by the 
CEO or COO. Therefore, no statement or promise by a supervisor, manager, or department head may be 
interpreted as a change in policy, nor will it constitute an agreement made with an employee unless the 
agreement is with a signed contract. 
 
Anti-Harassment Policy 
 
TriageLogic is committed to providing a work environment that is free from all forms of discrimination 
and conduct which can be considered harassing, coercive, or disruptive, including all forms of harassment 
based on protected factors (Race, Color, Sex, Religion, National Origin, Citizenship, Age, Marital Status, 
Disability or Sexual Orientation). In fact, the Company has established a “zero tolerance” policy 
regarding any form of harassment; however, management reserves the right to determine the appropriate 
discipline depending upon the severity of the offense. Harassment is a form of misconduct that 
undermines the integrity of the employment relationship. No employee should be subject to unsolicited 

 
 
 
70 
and unwelcome conduct, either verbal or physical. Each person in the organization is responsible for fostering 
mutual respect, for being familiar with this policy, and for refraining from conduct that violates this policy. 
 
Management Responsibility 
 
Harassment, whether committed by supervisory or non-supervisory personnel, is specifically prohibited as 
unlawful and against stated Company policy. In addition, the Company’s management is responsible for 
taking action against acts of harassment and investigating all complaints of harassment. Violation of this 
policy by an employee will subject said employee to disciplinary action up to and including termination.  If 
an employee believes that he/she has been subjected to harassment, they must use the complaint procedure 
set forth under this harassment policy. 
 
Manager/Supervisor   Responsibility 
 
Every manager/supervisor is responsible for providing a positive productive work environment free from 
harassment. Managers and supervisors are also responsible for doing their best to protect the Company 
from liability by ensuring that all employees are aware of the Company harassment policy, the Company 
complaint procedure and the penalties associated with violation of the policy. 
 
Employee Responsibility/Complaint Procedure 
 
Each employee is responsible for ensuring that his or her personal conduct and comments in the 
workplace support a professional environment that is free of unwelcome behavior that could be 
perceived as harassment or as demeaning, offensive or threatening with regard to gender and/or 
personal self-respect. 
 
Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) 
 
The ADA covers employers with 15 or more employees and generally prohibits discrimination against 
“qualified individuals with disabilities.” A qualified individual with a disability is an applicant or employee 
who can perform the essential functions of the job in question with or without reasonable accommodation. 
Disability is defined as: 
 
• 
a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities; 
• 
a record of such an impairment; or 
• 
being regarded as having such impairment. 
 
TriageLogic will reasonably accommodate qualified applicants and employees with disabilities unless making 
the accommodation imposes an undue hardship on the employer’s business. TriageLogic will reasonably 
accommodate known disabilities. Therefore, employees needing accommodation should speak directly with 
their manager/supervisor. The Company expects the reasonable accommodation process to be a mutual 
process by which the Company and employee search for a mutually acceptable reasonable accommodation. 
 

 
 
 
71 
TriageLogic will not discriminate against any qualified employees or applicants because they are related 
to a person with a disability. 
 
Initial Employment Status 
 
TriageLogic is committed to the premise that the organization and the employee benefit through long- 
term relationships. The Company’s future success and stability requires it to hire, train, and develop 
employees who will, in turn through their experience, knowledge, and commitment, maintain long- 
term relationships with patients. No interview process can be extensive enough to ensure 
compatibility between the individual and the organization necessary for a long-term relationship to 
develop.  
 
In order for employees to have time to assess TriageLogic, the job, and its requirements, and for the 
Company to have the opportunity to assess each employee, the first 90 days of employment are 
considered a mutual tryout period. It is during this 90-day introductory period that the employee and 
the Company mutually evaluate job requirements, performance, company policies and attitudes. This 
is a period when the decision is made as to how well the match has been made relative to the 
employee's needs as well as the Company's needs. Satisfactory completion of the introductory period 
does not alter the employment-at-will relationship. The evaluation period will be ongoing and will 
continue throughout the employment relationship. 
 
Predictive Index (PI) Survey 
 
In an effort to ensure the best fit for open positions as well as to find the most effective method for 
managing current employees, the PI Survey has become an important resource to TriageLogic. All 
applicants and independent contractors wishing to work with TriageLogic will be required to 
complete the PI survey. 
 
Drug Policy 
 
Prescription and over-the-counter drugs are not prohibited when taken in standard dosage and/or 
according to a physician’s prescription. Any employee taking prescribed or over-the-counter medications 
will be responsible for consulting the prescribing physician and/or pharmacist to ascertain whether the 
medication may interfere with safe performance of his/her job. If the use of a medication could 
compromise the safety of the employee, fellow employees or the public, it is the employee’s responsibility 
to use appropriate personnel procedures (e.g., call in sick, use leave, request change of duty, notify 
supervisor, notify company doctor) to avoid unsafe workplace practices. 
 
 
Salaries and Rates of Pay 
 
Salaries and rates of pay are determined on an individual basis and are considered strictly 
confidential. Salary or rate of pay should only be discussed as necessary, with the appropriate 
supervisor or human resources representative. Employees are not allowed to engage in discussions 
regarding their own salary or rate of pay with other employees. Nor are they allowed to engage in 
discussions regarding the salary or rate of pay of another employee. Even making inferences as to 
another’s salary or rate of pay will be considered a violation of this policy. 

 
 
 
72 
 
Employee Classifications 
 
For purposes of salary administration, eligibility for overtime payments, and employee benefits, 
TriageLogic classifies its employees as follows: 
 
Regular Full -Time Employee - A regular full-time employee is an individual whose employment is 
for no definite term and who is scheduled to work a minimum of 35 hours per week on a regular basis. 
 
Regular Part -Time Employee - A regular part-time employee is an individual whose employment is 
for no definite term and who is scheduled to work less than 30 hours on a regular basis. Regular part- 
time employees are not eligible for Paid Time Off (PTO) and may or may not be eligible for other 
benefits based on individual plan requirements. 
 
PRN Employee (“as needed”) – A PRN employee is an individual whose employment is for no 
definite term and who is periodically scheduled to work “as needed”. PRN employees may or may not 
be eligible for benefits based on individual plan requirements. 
 
Temporary Employee - A temporary employee’s work assignment is expected to be of limited duration 
(usually less than six months) to temporarily supplement the workforce or help complete a specific 
project. Temporary employees are not eligible for benefits. 
 
Exempt Employees – Employees who are not required to be paid overtime, in accordance with 
applicable federal and state wage and hour laws, for work performed beyond forty hours in a work 
week. Executives, managers, Healthcare Providers, professional employees, and certain employees in 
administrative positions are exempt. 
 
Employees vs. Contractors - Contractors may be hired to perform certain tasks for the company. These 
may include for example, editing documents and marketing material, providing medical information, and 
taking patient phone calls Contractors may be hired to perform certain tasks for the company. These may 
include for example, editing documents and marketing material, providing medical information, and 
taking patient phone calls Contractors are allowed to work at their own location of choice, as long as the 
choice does not conflict with the law such as HIPAA and HITECH. Contractors are also allowed to 
determine their own hours. Contractors will be given a list of Company needs and the Contractor can 
chose whether or not they want to work on the specific need.  Contractors will not receive designated 
usage of company property such as desks, and computers, although they may come to the one of our 
Company locations and borrow Company property if that is their preference from time to time. In 
addition, contractors may engage in work outside of TriageLogic. Each state and the IRS have different 
rules regarding who is a contractor and who is an employee.  Changes in such rules may require the 
Company to reclassify an employee’s status as an employee or contractor. While employees may have 
their schedule set by the company and will not be allowed to work for a competing company while 
employed by Triagelogic. The Company reserves the right to change an employee’s status in response 
to business needs. Employees may request a change in status to accommodate personal circumstances 
by discussing the request with their manager/supervisor or Human Resources Manager. In all cases, 
the decision to change the status of any position (if at all) will be based on the department’s workload, 

 
 
 
73 
available resources and an employee’s performance record. 
 
Employee Credit Cards 
 
Company employee credit cards are property of the company and must be immediately surrendered to an 
officer of the company upon voluntary or involuntary termination of the employment or contract. 
Company employee credit cards are strictly for business expenses and not for the employee’s personal use. 
Company employee credit cards cannot be used for food unless approved in advance, at which point a 
limit will be given for the specific occasion. Otherwise, food expenses should be paid by the employee, 
personally, then submitted for reimbursement, with receipts. All employee credit card expense over $25 
requires written approval, in advance, from either of the business owners. Email will be acceptable to 
request and grant approval. Some company credit cards are specific to an entity of the TriageLogic group 
and should be used only for the expenses of the specific entity, unless approved by a company officer. If 
the wrong card is used accidently, a company officer must be notified. Each cardholder is required to sign 
an attestation of the policy. 
 
Timekeeping 
 
Accurately recording time worked is the responsibility of every employee. Federal and state laws 
require the Company to keep an accurate record of time worked. Time worked is all the time actually 
spent on the job performing assigned duties. 
 
Altering, falsifying, tampering with timekeeping data, or recording time using another employee’s 
Time and Attendance data may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination of 
employment. It is the employee’s responsibility to review their time in the time & attendance program 
and alert their manager with discrepancies. 
 
Exempt employees are not required to record their time; however, they are expected to be 
professionally responsible and work their regularly scheduled hours plus any other hours required to 
satisfactorily complete their assigned responsibilities. 
 
Ethical Standards 
 
We expect all staff to act in an ethical manner that is self-guided and self-directed. Staff should not 
access websites that are questionable during their working hours. Any questions on websites or 
appropriate activities during working hours should be addressed with management. CORE 28 
Licensure, Registration and Certification 
 
Certain positions may require that an employee have or be able to obtain proper licensure, 
certification or registration. If these credentials are not achieved, or if they are withdrawn or 
suspended by an accrediting body, normal circumstances will require that the employee’s 
employment be terminated unless a change in employment status or job assignment can be made. 
In the case of certain licensed professionals, TriageLogic is required to report instances that 
could be cause for discipline to the professional licensing board. 
 
 Job Descriptions CORE 25 & 26 

 
 
 
74 
A job description is available for all TriageLogic employees that reflects the scope of their 
responsibilities and includes any required education, training and licensure. The job 
description is provided to the employee upon hire and reviewed and or revised annually at 
evaluation time to ensure the job description accurately reflects the job being performed. 
Staff Training Core 27 & 28TriageLogic provides staff with initial and ongoing training. A copy of 
all training provided will stay on file and in shared sugar sync folders. Any changes in rules or 
information are announced at the various company meetings as appropriate. A current policy and 
procedure manual 
is available to employees at all times through sugar sync. CORE 28 Upon initial employment staff 
will be trained on at least the following: Specific training directly related to their responsibilities, 
URAC version 5.0 standards, Clinical Support Tools (as applicable), HIPAA, Confidentiality, 
Conflict of Interest. Ongoing training will be provided as necessary as policies and/or procedures 
change, State/Regulatory updates are received. Should state or federal requirements conflict with 
URAC 5.0 standards, an employee would follow the more stringent requirement. Additional 
questions should be addressed with the CEO or legal counsel. CORE 28 c 
 
CORE 27 f Continuing education programs/additional training and tools can be requested on a one by 
one basis. Requests need to be sent to your direct supervisor. When continuing education has been 
approved by your supervisor, a copy of the training must be sent to your supervisor for inclusion in 
your personnel file. 
 
Staff Assessment Program CORE 26 & CORE 27 & 29 CORE 30 
 
All TriageLogic staff will receive an annual performance review at least once a year during an agreed 
month or in July (as a default) from their supervisor. Each employee may provide at this time an 
updated resume/CV for the personnel file. The current job description will be reviewed with the 
employee and updated/revised as necessary at this time. Staff members are asked to bring relevant 
documentation of their work as well as ongoing training documents to the performance evaluation. 
The review process will also include self-appraisal and anonymous appraisals from all other staff 
members that have had significant contact with the employee. The appraisal form will use a rating 
system of one through four and the combined ratings from all appraisals will be used to obtain an 
average rating for each category. Staff comments will be allowed on each appraisal and kept 
anonymous as well. 
Core 29b Staff licensure/certification will be verified at this time and signatures will be obtained 
annually on the following documents: Conflict of Interest, Confidentiality, HIPAA and any other 
documents here that may require signature. Core 16 f 
 
Information   Confidentiality 
 
How TriageLogic is perceived by its business associates, the media, legislators, regulatory agencies, 
special interest groups, and the general public is a direct result of the external communications 
activities carried out by our management and employees. These external relations have a significant 
impact on our business. In order to present the best image of TriageLogic, it is important that the 
messages we communicate are consistent with Company philosophy, policies and procedures. 
 

 
 
 
75 
Serious problems could be created for TriageLogic by unauthorized disclosure of internal information 
about the Company or its patients. Company personnel should not discuss internal matters or 
developments with anyone outside of the Company, except as required in the performance of regular job 
duties. 
 
Employees should contact their manager/supervisor if they are unsure as to what information is 
confidential. Outside inquiries regarding TriageLogic should be referred to the CEO. The CEO serves as 
an information channel for news media and for any person or organization outside the Company. He/she 
is responsible for approval of press releases, responding to media inquiries, and coordinating interviews 
with the media. 
 
TriageLogic has a Patient Confidentiality Acknowledgement (This is part of the HIPAA form) form that is 
presented to each newly hired employee. All employees are required to read this Acknowledgement and 
agree to its contents. Questions relating to confidentiality or possible violations of its provisions should be 
referred to the Human Resources Manager or CEO. 
 
During the course of employment, employees will have access to confidential information. Confidential 
information may include, but is not limited to, compensation information, patient lists and information, 
financial information, marketing strategies, and other related confidential information. This information 
is critical to the success of the Company and must not be divulged. Employees must not discuss 
confidential matters or release confidential information to any outside party. 
 
Additionally, an employee’s salary is confidential and is to be held in strict confidence by the employee 
and TriageLogic. Individual employee’s salary/wages are not public information. Breach of 
confidentiality regarding this information is not appropriate. 
 
Employees who improperly utilize or disclose Company or patient confidential information may be 
subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination. All employees with access to patient data 
are also required to sign the HIPAA Policy document (see below) 
 
TriageLogic Information Security Policy 
 
What is HIPAA, and what information is protected by it?   
 
HIPAA, short for the United States Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, is a set of 
standards introduced by Congress in 1996 that aim to protect the privacy of patient information in the 
healthcare industry by regulating how providers handle patient data while conducting business, as 
well as ensuring the continuity of individuals' healthcare coverage. 
 
There are two sections to the standard: HIPAA Title I, which focuses on protecting citizens' 
healthcare coverage if they are fired or laid off, and HIPAA Title II, which is focused more on 
patients' rights and how to properly transmit, share and store their information. 

 
 
 
75
HIPAA created a set of universal standards for exchanging and securing personal data via electronic 
data interchange (EDI), the goal being to protect all data that is personally identifiable to a specific 
person, regardless if it is communicated orally, electronically or in writing. 
 
The HIPAA privacy rule requires all health care providers, or any other organization that processes 
medical records, inform patients of their privacy rights, educate and train staff on how medical data 
should be properly handled, and implement and practice the required privacy and security policies in 
order to ensure that electronic health information of patients remain secure. 
 
Breaking down HIPAA security rules and compliance guidelines 
 
HIPAA's standards require that all health care industries apply and enforce certain protections. The 
implementation process will be different for every organization depending on its size, budget, risks 
and infrastructure complexity. But regardless of each organization's different needs in terms of 
HIPAA implementation, the general HIPAA requirements stay the same. 
 
• 
Organizations must have an administrative authority in charge of managing and enforcing 
HIPAA compliance rules, regulations and efforts. There should be a clear set of guidelines in 
place regulating who is and isn't permitted to access patient information. All access to sensitive 
data and systems should be monitored. 
• 
Documentation should be provided to patients informing them of their rights. 
• 
All corporate systems, machines and buildings must have physical and technical data and 
intrusion protection controls to prevent malicious hacker and unauthorized access. 
• 
There must be a traffic-monitoring device, such as a firewall, in place to examine activity coming 
into and leaving the organization's network. 
• 
Management should practice risk assessments, data handling policies, data loss prevention (DLP) 
and record all security policies and procedures 
 
 
Policy on Emails and other forms of communication 
 
Email is not secure. TriageLogic requires that email cannot contain PHI anywhere in the heading or 
body of the message. To view any PHI, the user has to log into the system with a user name and 
password. When communicating about patients via email, we refer to ticket numbers or note numbers 
without mentioning any PHI. Reports and recordings are sent as links for which the user has to login to 
view the PHI. 
 
None of the following items can be included in any unsecure communication: 
 
1. Names 
2. All geographical identifiers smaller than a state, except for the initial three digits of a zip code if, 
according to the current publicly available data from the Bureau of the Census: the geographic unit 
formed by combining all zip codes with the same three initial digits contains more than 20,000 
people; and the initial three digits of a zip code for all such geographic units containing 20,000 or 
fewer people is changed to 000 
3. Dates (other than year) directly related to an individual 
4. Phone numbers 
 

 
 
 
76 
5. Fax numbers 
6. Email addresses 
7. Social Security numbers 
8. Medical record numbers 
9. Health insurance beneficiary numbers 
10. Account numbers 
11. Certificate/license numbers 
12. Vehicle identifiers and serial numbers, including license plate numbers; 
13. Device identifiers and serial numbers; 
14. Web Uniform Resource Locators (URLs) 
15. Internet Protocol (IP) address numbers 
16. Biometric identifiers, including finger, retinal and voice prints 
17. Full face photographic images and any comparable images 
18. Any other unique identifying number, characteristic, or code except the unique code assigned by 
the investigator to code the data. 
 
 
 
The HIPAA Compliance Policy needs to be signed by all employees and contractors with access to 
patient data.

RATING FACTORS 
 
The following are conditions that should be considered when assessing the employee’s performance. 
 
JOB KNOWLEDGE: In depth knowledge of all requirements of the job. How well does the employee 
understand all phases of the job as defined by the performance standards set for the position? 
 
QUALITY OF WORK: Accuracy and neatness. Does the employee produce a high quality work product? Is 
quality work a priority for the employee? 
 
PRODUCTIVITY: Consider employee’s ability to prioritize and organize work effectively to meet assigned 
deadlines. Were assignments timely completed and appropriate follow-up implemented? Is the employee a self- 
starter? 
 
DEPENDABILITY: Employee needs little or no direction. To what extent can the employee be relied upon to 
carry out instructions; and the degree to which the employee can work with limited supervision? 
 
ATTENDANCE: Attendance and punctuality are very important in maintaining a normal work load and 
efficient schedule. Employees are expected to report to work regularly and be ready to perform their assigned 
duties at the beginning of their assigned work shift. Is the employee absent frequently? Are the absences 
affecting his/her performance? Does this pattern constitute a hardship on the work environment? 
 
RELATIONS WITH OTHERS: Consider employee’s abilities to maintain a positive and harmonious attitude 
in the work environment. How well does the employee relate to the supervisors, co-workers and the broader 
TriageLogic community? 
 
COMPLIANCE WITH STANDARDS: To what extent has the employee followed company policies and 
procedures, State and Federal Requirements and URAC standards? 
 
SUPERVISOR ABILITY: In the evaluation of this factor, consider the employee’s ability to organize, plan, 
train, delegate and control the work of subordinates in an effective manner. 
 
LEVELS  OF  PERFORMANCE 
 
The employee’s performance shall be rated in one of the following categories: 
 
EXCEED PERFORMANCE STANDARDS: An evaluation resulting from overall performance which is 
significantly above the performance standards of the position. 
 
ACHIEVES PERFORMANCE STANDARDS: An evaluation resulting from performance which fully meets 
the performance standards of the position. 
 
BELOW PERFORMANCE STANDARDS: An evaluation resulting from performance which fails to meetthe 
minimum performance standards of the position. The supervisor must contact Human Resources to initiate a 
Performance Improvement Plan, which must be completed jointly by the employee and the supervisor.

I. 
POLICY 
 
TriageLogic does not have a system for reimbursement, bonuses or incentives to staff or health care 
providers based on consumer utilization of health care services. 
 
Clients provide the TriageLogic service to their patients and TriageLogic provides no additional 
financial incentive to reflect on patient care. All of our consumers come to TriageLogic through their 
medical representative. 
 
The nurses who take call for the call center are either an employee on an hourly/fixed salary or 
contractors paid an hourly rate. Nurses are not incentivized on the number of calls handled in an hour 
or a shift. 
 
TriageLogic contracts with clients who then in turn control the access to the service through their own 
phone system. TriageLogic does not receive any financial incentive from the clients except for the pre- 
negotiated fee schedule for services. The fee structure does not have any impact on the nurse managing 
the patient calls. 
 
In some particular cases (such as in delegated work to PRN), TriageLogic will pay owners on a per call 
basis. However, owners do not have direct contact with practices and they cannot directly influence 
patients to make phone calls. Patients come directly through their physicians, and the physicians are the 
ones who instruct their patients to call nurses. Triage Logic’s medical director and the CEO participate 
in meetings with the PRN owners to ensure that they are not able to influence patient phone calls. In 
addition, medical Dir. is responsible for overseeing nursing quality and random checks on past phone 
calls to ensure the highest level of quality of care, and no influence on patient phone calls. Finally, 
triage logic also conducts patient surveys and research to study patient phone call patterns and patient 
satisfaction from the nurse call.

CLIENT AND CONSUMER ACCESS TO PROGRAM SERVICES 
 
Refer to Clinical Document 
a. Client Access 
 
Our agreement with the client has a toll free line – the client uses that number to forward calls to 
the triage system as per our pre-agreed coveragetimes. 
 
b. Consumer/Clinical Access 
 
Patients/callers access triage services either by calling an assigned telephone number specific to the 
participating physician’s office, or as a call forwarded to our contracted medical answering service. 
 
Every call put into the system remains in the common queue until a nurse claims the call. This 
ensures that no call can be left unanswered. As part of TriageLogic’s Telephone Performance 
Standards, the following information related to access is monitored on a monthly basis: 
• 
Call Volume 
• 
Average speed to answer 
• 
Call Abandonment Rate 
• 
Percentage of Calls on Hold 
• 
Average Blockage Rate

Client/Consumer Complaints 
 
 
1. All complaints come through the provider (client) who is contracting for services. 
 
2. Each client has a designated client relations manager to contact directly to inform us of any 
complaints. TriageLogics client relations manager contacts the client and informs them about the 
process to get the complaint resolved and also lets them know that they are allowed to speak 
directly to the medical director if they need to speak to someone in addition to filing the incident 
report. Core 35b The Client Relations Manager takes on the complaint and places it in an incident 
report. Core 35a   
 
3. The Client Relations Manager gathers information about the complaint and forwards it to the 
appropriate party - the manager of the non-clinical staff or the nurse manager on call for the clinical 
staff. 
 
4. The manager of the non-clinical staff or the nurse manager reviews the complaint, listens to the 
call, reviews the note and talks to the agent or nurse involved. 
 
5. Then manager will write a summary of their findings, how the complaint was addressed and if the 
provider was informed. 
 
6. All complaint forms are sent to the medical director to sign off and discuss at the weekly nurse 
manager meeting. CORE 35c 
 
7. If the nurse manager feels the medical director needs to be involved in the resolution, then they will

patients with an immediate threat of health and safety. 
 
The Clinical Manager of the call center can be reached by non-clinical staff 24 hours a day/7 days a 
week to respond to issues or questions related to patient care. Patients who have problems which are 
thought to be potentially life, limb or vision threatening will be triaged as “Urgent” and directed to 
seek care within 24 hours or sooner. These patients may be directed to ED, urgent care center, or 
physician office. TriageLogic also maintains specific procedures for special circumstances/high risk 
cases. Please see the related documents at the end of this policy.

I. 
POLICY 
It is the policy of TriageLogic to create materials that consumers/patients have the capacity to obtain, 
process, and understand in order to make appropriate decisions regarding their health and that materials 
are written in plain language. The following three elements will be considered when communicating 
with patients: 
Plain Language is defined as: Communication that uses short words and sentences, common terms 
instead of (medical) jargon, and focuses on the essential information recipients need to understand. 
TriageLogic interacts with consumers through nurse triage.   TriageLogic nurses only give patients 
advice from standard guidelines provided by Dr. Bart Schmitt and David Thompson.  Under no 
circumstances are nurses allowed to use outside resources unless pre-approved by the Medical Director 
and made available from within the software. 
Nurses are allowed to email health information after they have completed a full assessment of the patient 
using the standard triage guidelines.  These information sheets are provided within the Schmitt Thompson 
database. 
When emailing a patient, staff are asked to communicate in ways understandable to the consumer, 
without using complex medical terms or jargon.  Core 40 c 
Any materials created internally for consumers will be reviewed by the Medical Director to verify that it 
is written in plain language.  After approval it will be discussed with the nurse managers at the weekly 
meeting.  Once the nurse managers and Medical Director are in agreement, nurses will be informed and it 
will be uploaded to the software and made available to the nurses.
